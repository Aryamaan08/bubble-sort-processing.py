# Bubble Sort in Processing.py
Hello, I am making a bubble sort visualization based on @shiffman's project- but in Processing.py.
There is a bug with either the swapping mechanism or the implementation of the swap() function. If you can help, please open a pull request!
I am a beginner in Processing.py and since I am translating Java code to Python, some of the concepts are mistranslated. Please help in fixing the bug!
